To compile SiNPle, please install ocaml (http://www.ocaml.org/docs/install.html) and run the following command.

  ocamlopt.opt -O3 -o SiNPle SiNPle.ml

This will compile the binary SiNPle and SiNPle -h would give information on all the options.
An example of generating SiNPle variant calls from the bamfile example.bam would be,

  samtools mpileup example.bam | SiNPle > variants.txt
